        <th ><h1>Why should you learn<span style="color: red;"> Taekwondo?</span></h1>
        <p> Taekwondo first oringinated in Korea during the mid-20th century, primarily developed by Korean Martial artists who combined elements of 
        traditional Korean fighting styles like "Taekkyon" and Subak" with influences from Japanese Karate and Chinese matrial arts.
        <br><br>
        With the two different fighting styles incorperated within the style of Taekwondo, each student will be able to excel in a full body workout every lesson. This will allow them to advance
        themselves physically and mentally.
        <br><br>
        While learning the main techniques and abilities there are five "Tenents" of Taekwondo that is always said at the end of a class. They are the following:<br><br>
        <span><strong>
        Courtesy&emsp;&emsp;Integrity&emsp;&emsp;Perseverance&emsp;&emsp;Self Control&emsp;&emsp;Indomitable Spirit</bold></span>
