             <br><br>In 2013, Gabriella was injrued with a broken foot and out of class for a few months. 
            In 2020, she pulled a muscle in my chest after overworking myself which led to my body becoming physically ill. For a few months, 
            her family and others didn't know what was wrong. In November,she was diagnosed with Hashimoto's Disease which effects the thyroid located in the front of the neck, and in front of the trachea. 
            Gabriella never let anything stop me because her continue to push through like a bull, and deep down, she knew she is strong and the more she pushed, 
            the stronger she became. If she can do it with all the trouble she went through, then you can too.
